# dylan-hash (dhash)

Using sha512 with a random salt to generate a safe password hashing algo.

This code is as non blocking as I can get it in node but probably shouldnt be used in production as I dont really know what I'm doing.

I imagine this is how bcrypt and argon like hashes work but idk 🤷‍♂️
